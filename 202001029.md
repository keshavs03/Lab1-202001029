## 1. FRs and NFRs for Library Managment System
### Functional Requriements:  
1. Allow the librarian to add and remove new members.  
2. Allow the user to search for books based on title, publication date, author, etc., and find their location in the library.
3. Users can request, reserve, or renew a book.  
4. Librarian can add and manage the books.  
5. The system should notify the user and librarian about the overdue books.
6. The system calculates the fine for overdue books on their return.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. #### Usability 
    ##### The key non-functional need for a library management system is usability. Everyone should be able to understand the user interface (UI) and find the necessary information without any extra training. Depending on the needs, other languages can be offered.

2. #### Accuracy
    ##### The information that is recorded about the books and the fines that are assessed must be accurate, dependable, and consistent.

3. #### Availability
    ##### When the library is open, the System must be functional, and if it is not, it must be repaired in an hour or less. Within two seconds or fewer, the system need to react to the queries.

4. #### Maintainability
    ##### Adding new features and changing the programme should be as straightforward as possible, and the software should be simple to maintain. The software must also be portable in addition to this.
## 2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.
### Scope
* The app is optimized for Android with low-latency so that it works in real-time for the user.  
    * While the deaf community has benefitted from innovation in the app space, up until now its been mostly in the areas of sound amplification and text to speech/speech to text.  
* Closed Captioning Posibilities: 
    * Several companies have used the capabilities of AI to facilitate this feature which will translate audio into text instantaneously.
* Enhanced language prediction: 
    * The application of AI in processing brain imaging to better understand health conditions has become a new trend in the medical technology field.
### Feastures :
* Convolutional Neural Network: 
    * Average inference time is about 15 ms so the user never has to worry about missing a beat and the app can also be synced with a wearable device.
### Non-Functional Requirements:
* #### Maintainability
    * ##### Adding new features and changing the programme should be as straightforward as possible, and the software should be simple to maintain. The software must also be portable in addition to this.
* Performance and scalability
    * How fast does the system return results? How much will this performance change with higher workloads?
* Reliability, maintainability, availability
    *  How frequently do the system's critical failures occur? How long does it take to resolve the problem once it occurs? And how does downtime compare to user availability time?
* Security 
    * How well are the system and its data protected against attacks?
